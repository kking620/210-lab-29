Project Overview:
My project creates an airport simulation, that is designed to predict the changes of the average efficiency
and volume of traffic within an airport over the course of 1 year, which has been broken up into 24 two week time periods.
This software will illustrate the potential impact of certain events on the predicted efficiency of these airports.

Implementation:
I plan to use a std:map to store and manage data related to the different attributes of each airport across these different airports.
This map will also categorize the averages for each of the given attributes, which will be designated into three std::lists representing
number of people within the airport, how many delays were reported, and  
Simluated Events:
